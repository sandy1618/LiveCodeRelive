### Setting up venv 
Use requirments.txt for having all the libraries required for this repo. 
Note: also add the folder for the venv in .gitignore as its good practice for many reasons. 



``` bash
python3 -m venv liveenv
source liveenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Alternatively , Run the bash script , env_setup.sh
